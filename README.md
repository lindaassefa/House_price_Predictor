This project designed to predict the prices of residential properties based on various features. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze datasets containing information about different attributes of houses, such as size, location, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. By training on historical housing data, the model learns patterns and relationships within the data to make accurate predictions about the prices of new properties.

Features:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant features that influence house prices.
Model training: Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks to train the predictive model.
Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared.
Deployment: Integrating the trained model into an application or service where users can input information about a house and receive a predicted price.
